  "body": "Scaffold\r\n========\r\n\r\nAn Android library designed to help you quickly create prototypes and production applications that follow the latest material\r\ndesign guidelines.\r\n\r\nFor more information see [the website][4] or [the wiki][1].\r\n\r\nGradle\r\n------\r\n\r\nScaffold is available via jcenter. It depends on several of the [Android support libraries][2]:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    compile 'com.lamcreations.scaffold:scaffold:1.0.3'\r\n    \r\n    def androidSupportLibVersion = \"24.2.0\";\r\n\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:support-core-utils:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:support-core-ui:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:preference-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:design:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n    compile \"com.android.support:support-annotations:${androidSupportLibVersion}\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nScaffold is a collection of activities, fragments and views mostly designed to be extended. By using\r\nthese classes and following the conventions of this library you can very quickly create an Android app\r\nthat follows the [material design guidelines][3] without needing to worry about a lot of boiler plate code.\r\n\r\nActivities that you can extend:\r\n*  ToolbarActivity\r\n*  CoordinatorActivity\r\n*  DrawerActivity\r\n*  TabActivity\r\n*  TabDrawerActivity\r\n*  CollapsingToolbarActivity\r\n*  CollapsingToolbarDrawerActivity\r\n*  CollapsingToolbarTabDrawerActivity\r\n*  SearchableActivity\r\n*  SettingsActivity\r\n*  SplashScreenActivity\r\n*  VideoSplashScreenActivity\r\n\r\nFragments that you can extend:\r\n*  RecyclerViewFragment\r\n*  SettingsFragment\r\n*  NavigationViewFragment\r\n*  NavigationRecyclerViewFragment\r\n\r\nViews that you can use/extend:\r\n*  NavigationViewHeader\r\n*  AutoFitTextureView\r\n*  RoundedImageView\r\n*  CollapsingToolbarTabLayout\r\n\r\nOther classes you might find helpful:\r\n*  ImagePagerAdapter\r\n*  BasicRecyclerViewAdapter\r\n\r\nFor more information see [the wiki][1].\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute code to Scaffold you can do so through GitHub by\r\nforking the repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\nWhen submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions\r\nand style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]: https://github.com/lmckenzie/scaffold/wiki\r\n [2]: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html\r\n [3]: https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html\r\n [4]: http://lmckenzie.github.io/scaffold\r\n",
